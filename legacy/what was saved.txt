Sorry for the delay - this response got caught up in the rate limiter.
Yes, the archive functionality is available to everyone, and will export the source code, documentation, license, issues, and downloads.

For source code history, it depends on the source code type. For Git and Mercurial projects, we'll include the .git/.hg folder so you have the full history; for TFS, it'll be just the snapshot as of read-only.
