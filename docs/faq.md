## #1 - CMDR.EXE disapears when I unpack the zip file

If the EXE file disapears, this is because your anti-virus quarantined the file because it doesnt have a digital signature. 
In this case make an exception for CMDR.exe.

CMDR has a perfect VirusTotal check: [0 out of 72](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ab1db0d627782cfd55867addbac61d55be9debed9c3483ee527733eecf7b6610/detection)
